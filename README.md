# LearnChemE-jupyter-notebooks
This repository is just to write the code available on learnChemE (https://sites.google.com/a/learncheme.com/learncheme/) using an open source programming languages: python and julia. I will try to deliver most of the wolfram CDF simulations and matlab code as jupyter notebooks for academia purposes.
